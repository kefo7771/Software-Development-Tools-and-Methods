Snippet 1:
  Format:
    No line spaces makes it harder to read
    Tabs successfully provide organization to logic    
  Style:
    Code is formatted well with tabs, so that I can follow along.
    Loops are organized along with definitons,etc.
  Naming:
    Variable names are vague, harder to understand code without following each variable path
    Change variable names from one letter to something more descriptive
  Design:
    No comments to follow along and understand train of thought
  Readability:
    Readability is hampered by lack of spaces and vague variables
    Unclear of overall purpose of code with no comments
    Variable declarations are too complex, hard to read what they are equal to
  Functionality:
    On line 19, the file path does not exist. Need another solution than hard-coding path.

Snippet 2: 
  Format:
    Format looks good.
  Style:
    Style looks good.
  Naming:
    Variables are better named this time, give context to what their role is
  Design:
    Some comments, but they need to be more assertive in what they are describing
    Still unclear on purpose of code as it seems so too is the author
  Readability:
    Some variable declarations are too complex to easily read and understand, see "new"
  Functionality:
    Code breaks at lines 22 and 55
    File path line does not seem to find a suitable file path to run this code
         
Snippet 3: 
  Format:
    Spacing provides blocks of thought to follow easily
    Tabs continue to be good
  Style:
    Style still looks good.
  Naming:
    Variable names are still easy to understand.
  Design:
    Less comments than before, need them for better understanding
  Readability:
    Comments are reduced, leading to harder understanding
    Comment on line 56 shouldn't cite the directions
  Functionality:
    File path is hard coded in again
    This causes problems running the code as I don't have that directory on my computer

Snippet 4:
  Format:
    Looks solid
  Style:
    Looks solid
  Naming:
    Variables are named well
  Design:
    Existing comments are assertive and descriptive of dfferent code portions
    Could use some more comments towards the end describing purpose of lines 67-75
  Readability:
    Easy to read with spacing, tab formatting, etc.
  Functionality:
    Was unable to get the code to find a directory still
