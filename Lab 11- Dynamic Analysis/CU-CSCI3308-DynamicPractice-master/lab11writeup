1. When I run pi, it seg faults.

2. Line 89 = crash

3. The pointer pt was not allocated.

4. gdb> b zeroDist

5. p other_pt->x 
   x = -865427027

6. p other_pt->y
   y = 369343149

7. delete breakpoints

8. The code is leaking memory. It is has definitely lost 31,999,984 bytes and possibly lost 16 bytes.

9. The problem lines are 41 and 92

10. The problem on line 41 was that we didn't free the memory space used by zero_pt. I fixed it by using the function free(zero_pt). The problem on line 92 was that pt also had to be freed up. I used free(pt).

11. Iterations: 7,550,000 iterations
    Program run time: 1.00 s

12. Top 5 Places:
    1. zeroDist -- 70.62%
    2. dist -- 25.63%
    3. malloc <cycle 1> -- 19.74%
    4. pow -- 18.98% 
    5. random -- 16.31

13. I can make the code faster by getting rid of the call to dist, as it takes up a large amount of processing time. To fix this, we can incorporate this code directly into zeroDist instead of calling a separate function. Also, I got rid of the zero pointer as it was redundant.

14. Original time : .13s
    New time: .08s
